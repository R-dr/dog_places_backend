 <h3>But first here's how to use the site. </h3> 
 <p>You can search for locations with the handy little search bar above the map. You can review anywhere you've been and you can even upload a photo of your time there!</p>
 <hr>
 <h3>Editing and Deleteing</h3>
 <p> If you want to edit a location's details or delete a location for whatever reason, you can do so with the edit and delete buttons. The changes will then go to our administration team for approval. (just to make sure the changes are family friendly and accurate) Please note: this also sends your email address over to the admin team so they can get in touch with you should the need arise.</p>
 <hr>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Given this is a family site profanity or abusive language will not be tolerated in any volume and may result in your account being deleted.</p>
 <hr>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Now with all that out of the way we hope you enjoy your time and get Off The Leash soon!</p>
